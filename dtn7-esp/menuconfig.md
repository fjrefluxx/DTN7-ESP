# DTN7-esp Config
## Basic Settings

### Router Type
<br>**default** Simple Broadcast

Select the type of router to be used

Options:<br>
**Simple Broadcast**: Basic epidemic style router, works with all CLAs and, if ones that broadcasts bundles are present, periodically broadcasts each bundle. See [main readme "Routing"](/README.md#routing) for more information.

**Epidemic Router**:  more advanced epidemic router, requires information about network peers;  therefore, CLAs need to implement an advertisement mechanism. See [main readme "Routing"](/README.md#routing) for more information.



### Time Interval in seconds in which to retry stored bundles

<br>**default** 400

### Time Interval in seconds in which CLAs not using the queue system are polled

<br>**default** 10

###  Attach Previous Node Block
Select whether to attach a previous node block to bundles.
<br>**default** FALSE
    

### Attach Hop Count Block
 Select whether to attach a hop count block to bundles.
<br>**default** FALSE

<br> **range** 1-255
<br>**default** 5

### Accurate Clock
Select whether the node has an accurate Clock, synchronized to DTN time, if set to false, a bundle age block will be added to locally generated bundles
<br>**default** FALSE

### Use GPS
Choose if GPS is to be used for time synchronization (the local clock will be synchronized to DTN time, as defined in RFC9171). Additionally, GPS is used to track the position of the local node.
<br>**default** FALSE

### GPS UART Number
If *Use GPS* is enabled (only then is this option visible), choose the UART peripheral to use.
<br>**default** 1
<br> **range** 0-2

### GPS UART RX pin
If *Use GPS* is enabled (only then is this option visible), select the pin used as UART RX (connect GPS module TX pin to the specified pin).
<br>**default** 16

### GPS Update Interval
If *Use GPS* is enabled (only then is this option visible), select the interval in seconds in which GPS position is read and updated.
<br>**default** 600

### LifeTime

<br>**default** 86400000

### Send Status Report

<br>**default** FALSE

### Maximum Peer Age
 Maximum Time a node is stored in the list of known Peers after not being seen, in seconds.
<br>**default** 600
   
### Override Bundle Lifetime
If this setting is enabled, the lifetime stored in the Primary Block of bundles is ignored, and a custom value is used instead.
<br>**default** false

### Lifetime in Seconds
If *Override Bundle Lifetime* is enabled (only then is this option visible), this setting determines which lifetime, in seconds, is used.
<br>**default** 600

### Use Bundle ID's for reception Confirmation
If enabled, the local node stores a set of received bundle ID hashes. The hashes of the IDs of all received bundles are inserted into this set, which is emptied during each BPoL advertisement.
Additionally, each node in the forwarded-to list of stored bundles has a set of bundle ID hashes that is used to check if the last transmission of the bundle to the node was successful.
Enabling this affects: EpidemicRouter::checkForwardedTo(), encodeAdvertisePacket(), DTN7::bundleReceiver(), Node (Class), Node::serialize(), BundleProtocolAgent::bundleReception().
Only compatible with **EpidemicRouter** and **BPoL compatible LoRa CLA**.
For more information see [main readme "experimental features"](/README.md#extras--experimental-features).
